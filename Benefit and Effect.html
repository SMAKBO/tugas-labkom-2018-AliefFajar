			<h1> Provides a Deep Yet Gentle Exfoliation for Clearer Skin.</h1>
			<p>No matter what type of skin you have, everyone should be exfoliating at least once or twice a week to keep the skin clear and healthy. Unlike synthetic beads in many conventional products that can scratch and irritate your skin, a low concentration salicylic acid provides a gentler yet even more effective exfoliation.</p>

			<P>Salicylic acid helps to soften keratin, a protein in the skin that makes skin cells stick together.
			This makes it much easier to slough away dead skin cells while removing dirt and impurities from deep down in the pores and reducing redness and inflammation. Not only will your skin look healthier after just one use, it will feel silky soft to the touch.</P>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
	<h1>Stimulates Collagen Production and Brightens the Complexion.</h1>
	<p>Salicylic acid helps to promote the formation of collagen, an important structural protein that decreases in our skin as we age. Improved collagen production means a plumper, less saggy skin with fewer fine lines and wrinkles.
	With regular use, salicylic acid will also actually help to reduce the thickness of the dead skin layer so your skin will look more radiant.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
	<h1> Reduces Pore Size for a More Even Complexion. </h1>
	<p> Large pores are a common complaint we hear from women of all ages and it's one that is easier to treat than you may think.
	Large pores are usually due to pores clogged with oil and debris. Salicylic acid helps to reduce excess sebum as well as thoroughly clearing the pores, making it perfect for reducing large pores and giving you skin you feel confident in.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
	<h1> Natural Treatment for Hyperpigmentation </h1>
	<p>Hyperpigmentation is darker areas of skin that can be caused by an array of factors from sun damage to hormonal changes. Salicylic acid's ability to inhibit melanin production, combined with its gentle exfoliating properties, means it will help to reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation with minimal irritation. </p>

	Irritation
	Common side effects of salicylic acid medications include burning, stinging and redness. These can be exacerbated if you are using other medications that contain ingredients like alcohol, exfoliants or benzoyl peroxide.
	<p> 
	Salicylic acid is a chemical that is similar to aspirin. Children, pregnant women and nursing mothers should not use it without a doctor's supervision. Children are more likely to experience serious skin reactions from salicylic acid, and it can be absorbed into the bloodstream if used for a long time on large parts of the body. The effects of the medication on pregnant and breast-feeding women are not well known.</p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h1 class="card-title">Photosensitivity</h1>
    <p class="card-text">The FDA warns that salicylic acid medications can make you more sensitive to the sun. It makes your skin more susceptible to sunburn, discoloration and other types of damage from the sun's ultraviolet rays. Always use a high SPF sunscreen when you are treating your skin with salicylic acid, or look for products that already contain sunscreen</p>
