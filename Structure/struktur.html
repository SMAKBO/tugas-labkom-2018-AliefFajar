	<h2><center>Chemistry</center></h2>
<p>The chemical formula for salicyclic acid is C6H4(OH)CO2H.

Salicylic acid is both a caroxylic acid and a phenol. A carboxylic acid is an organic (carbon-containing) acid characterized by the presence of a carboxyl group, which has the formula -C(=O)OH, usually written -COOH or -CO2H. A phenol, in the general sense of the term, is any compound which contains a six-membered aromatic ring, bonded directly to a hydroxyl group (-OH).

In salicylic acid, the OH group is adjacent to the carboxyl group.

Salicylic acid is only slightly soluble in water, but is soluble in ethanol and ether.

<h2><center>Production</center></h2>
Salicylic acid is commercially prepared from sodium salicylate, which is produced from sodium phenoxide and carbon dioxide at high pressure and temperature in the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction. Sodium salicylate is acidified to give the desired salicylic acid:
